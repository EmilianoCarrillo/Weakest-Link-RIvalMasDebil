This was a program I built for an school activity. It resembles the TV show "Weakest Link" (or "El Rival más débil" for latinos). 
It was built on flash using ActionScript 3.0.
You can tweak it as you wish.

## HOW TO USE IT
There has to be Max-9 players playing and a judge. 
There are 8 rounds and a DeathMatch where the winner is chosen.

1. Press the space bar to go to maim menu
2. Choose a Round
3. The quizmaster will ask a trivia question to each player in turn. Every correct answer adds money to the bank. Eight consecutive correct answers raises the bank to the maximum 1000 points. An incorrect answer reduces the bank to zero.
4. Before the question is asked a player may say, "Bank!" to insure the bank's current level will be carried over to the next round. (whenever a player says "BANK!" you have to press the space bar to store the points accumulated) 
5. The round is complete when the timer has run out. The players then vote to eliminate one of them from the game. The next round continues with the remaining players and less time on the clock.
7. When only two players remain which ever player gets the most correct responses after each is asked five questions is the winner.
